The word “Animation” derives from an ancient Latin word “Anima” what means “Soul.”
Attempts of breathing in life into static artificial objects...

Why animations are important
(https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/bad-web-design-a-look-at-the-most-hilariously-terrible-websites-from-around-the-web)
	- misconception : animations are just to inject some fun (old web).
	- reality : enhances usability and adds features.
		- attracts attention and directs focus.
		- interactivity becomes intuitive.
		- in the web today, more data than ever.
			- animations play a role in how this data is presented and absorbed.
			- e.g. http://www.thehappyforecast.com/W/
		- smoothing out the hidden workings of the site (e.g. loading elements, etc.).

Why use GSAP:
	- handles transform inconsistencies across browsers.
	- animate CSS
		- Simplest tools for 90% of functionality:
			- opacity
			- transform
	- incredibly powerful with SVGs
		- Why SVGs are better than images.
			- scales to all device sizes
			- small if done right
			- animate elements
			- widely supported
	- staggering and arrays
		- repeating patterns (with variations) on multiple elements
		- minimises code needed
		- allows for impressive results with minimal planning and time
	- timelining
		- stacking
		- time offset (and negative offset)
		- grouping
		- relative labels
		- bend / reverse / stop time
		- modular
		- nested timelines

How to make animations work for you:
	- infographics used to gain huge conversion,
		now you can make them interactive and responsive with GSAP.
	- small filesize for components, yet big wow factor.
		- e.g. hicarbyecar speedometer SVG.
	- tutorials and walkthroughs
		- e.g. my work in hicarbyecar.
